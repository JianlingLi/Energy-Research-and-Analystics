**Abstract** — The prominence of hydroelectricity in Nordic Europe's energy landscape is undeniable, with countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland harnessing their abundant water resources for power generation. Over the past decade, the dynamics of hydroelectricity utilization in these nations have evolved in the context of broader energy transitions and environmental considerations. This study delves deep into a comprehensive dataset detailing hydroelectricity production and consumption across these Nordic European countries, juxtaposed with their associated carbon emissions over the same period. Using advanced data analytics, we dissect trends, fluctuations, and the broader implications of hydroelectricity's role in the energy mix. By drawing connections between hydroelectricity consumption and carbon emissions, our research aims to unveil the environmental efficiency of these energy strategies. This analysis not only presents a snapshot of the current state of hydroelectricity in Nordic Europe but also provides insights that could influence future energy policy and sustainable decision-making in the region.

**Ⅰ	INTRODUCTION**

Over the past few decades, the global energy sector has witnessed transformative changes, with a marked shift towards renewable energy sources. Nordic Europe, characterized by its vast natural landscapes and abundant water resources, has historically been a hub for energy production and innovation. With countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, the region possesses the natural capability and technological expertise to harness diverse energy sources, particularly hydroelectricity. While Norway is globally recognized as a significant oil and gas producer, its reliance on these fossil fuels is not sustainable in the long run. 

According to the 2023 report ‘GHG emissions of all world countries’ [1] from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), global Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions had followed an increasing trend since the beginning of the 21st century and until 2019. In 2022, global GHG emissions primarily consisted of CO2, resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels (71.6%), CH4 contributed 21% to the total, while the remaining share of emissions comprised N2O(4.8%) and F-gases(2.6%). Hence, the imperative to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change has never been more pressing. Understanding the relationship between energy production and emissions is crucial for informed policy-making and sustainable development. Norway, with its unique energy profile, presents a compelling case study to explore these dynamics. 

**Ⅱ	RESEARCH DESIGN METHODOLOGY**

Based on the research motivation, we have specified our research questions:
Research question 1: What proportion of Norway’s hydropower supply and consumption among the Nordic countries in the last decade?
Research question 2: How is Norway’s contribution to the energy mix compared to other Nordic countries in the same period?

The research is applied research that is based on the case study, using a mix-methods with archival research to gather evidence from multiple data sources to provide a topic overview and answer specific research questions. Referring to the research decision-making structure below, the research methodology design covers eight levels, from shallow to deep, and runs through three phases: strategy, tactical, and operational.

**A.	Strategy Phase**

1.	Applied Research
The two research questions tend to search for the patterns, the correlations between hydropower production, consumption, emissions, and population in Nordic Europe, and search for the impact on the country’s carbon emissions during the same period. Hence, the research outcome of this study will be applied research.

2.	Inductive Research
Based on inductive, the research moves begins with specific observations, detects theoretical patterns, and develops some general conclusions. In this case, the paper observes the collected data of hydropower generation and consumption, combines it with the population and the CO2 emissions in the Nordic countries, detects the trends, discovers their correlations, and deeply develops the theory of essence through phenomenon. Therefore, the purpose of this research can be classified as inductive research.
	
3.	Descriptive Research
The research questions start with ‘How’ and ‘What’ as they aim to describe the hydropower contribution and its impact on carbon emissions, which is more focused than exploratory research and goes further than exploratory research. Thus, the study is demonstrated in the descriptive research method.

4.	Positivist Research
	Positivist research assumes that the social world is made up of facts that can be studied like the natural world using a scientific method. It aims to discover the truth and general laws of cause and effect in social behavior. Likewise, the study aims to discover the correlation between the collected datasets and lead to some findings.

**B.	Tactical Phase**

1.	Quantitative Research
Quantitative research involves studies that refer to collecting quantitative data directly or cases where qualitative data is quantified to allow for statistical analysis, it provides objective measurement and analysis of the variables in question. The research collects datasets from the real world. For instance, the datasets from the authority organization, allow for the precise quantification of the contribution of hydropower to the energy mix and its impact on carbon emissions.

2.	Case Study
Case study research inquiry employs multiple methods of data collection to gather information from a variety of sources to investigate a phenomenon (contemporary or historical) in its natural setting. A case study involves several steps including designing, conducting a case study, analyzing data, and developing a conclusion. In this paper, the related hydropower data recourse come from authority institutes and databases, and they are historical data from the past decade. In addition, the study follows a research design, conducting a case study by hydropower generation, consumption, relevant population, and emissions data visualization and classification. Moreover, data visualization graphs are analyzed and further developed to a conclusion. Thence, the research is mainly based on case studies.

**C.	Operation Phase**

1.	Archival Research
Archival research is one of the data collection methods, it is the investigation of hard historical data that is archived by organizations, which may require permission to access the data, or it can be publicly available. The approach includes locating the data, systematically collecting the data, and analyzing, and interpreting the data. The archival research approach can be based on qualitative or quantitative data. The data resources of this paper can be publicly accessed as they are from the authority organization and database. The data are historical, quantitative, and qualitative in nature. In terms of the data collection approach, the study is on the same line as the archival research approach.

2.	Statistical Analysis
	Statistical analysis is used for analyzing quantitative data, it is one of the data analysis methods. The data can be collected in quantitative form and statistics are applied to analyze the data. Alternatively, the data can be collected in qualitative form and then transformed into quantitative form. In the paper, all the data are collected from the real world in quantitative form. Additionally, the study also applies to code quantitative data technology to systematically capture and visualize the process of each inflection data point based on hydropower production and consumption historical data, as well as the emissions data. Moreover, the ‘Pearson’ correlation applies to measure the linear correlations between hydropower production and consumption, population, and emissions. Furthermore, the research applies machine learning technology to classify the hydropower production and consumption levels in northern Europe countries. What’s more, the datasets can be fitted into a predictive model to forecast future trends.     

**D.	Target population**

Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden

**Ⅲ	RESEARCH   STRATEGY**

**A.	Data Collection**

The data resource of this study is collected from an official energy authority and an independent global database.

Established in 2003, the Energy Institute (EI) [3] is a professional organization for engineers and professionals in energy-related fields. With its foundational objective being promoting the science of energy and fuels for the public benefit, EI has made significant strides in fostering industry knowledge. Their credibility is further bolstered by partnerships with global financial entities such as KPMG and KEARNEY. Furthermore, the data compilation is undertaken by Heriot-Watt University, renowned for its research integrity. The selection of the EI dataset in the research is due to its extensive collection of global energy data, including detailed statistics on hydropower generation and consumption. Its data is widely recognized for accuracy and comprehensiveness, making it an invaluable resource for analyzing trends in hydropower usage, particularly in Nordic European countries. The Institute's longstanding reputation and partnerships with global financial entities like KPMG and KEARNEY lend additional credibility to its data. This makes it a reliable source for understanding the evolution and current state of hydropower, which is central to our research objectives.

The dataset ‘fossil CO2 emissions’ is provided by the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) [1], which is a multipurpose, independent, global database of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollution on Earth. EDGAR provides independent emission estimates compared to what is reported by the European Member States or by Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [4], using international statistics and a consistent IPCC methodology. The dataset of EDGAR is selected for its independent and comprehensive database of global CO2 emissions. This dataset is crucial for our research as it provides an independent assessment of carbon emissions, enabling a more nuanced analysis of the environmental impact of hydropower. The use of EDGAR's data is particularly relevant in contrasting reported emissions with actual levels, thereby offering a deeper insight into the environmental efficacy of hydropower. 

**B.	Data Verification Process**

Cross-Referencing with Other Databases: To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, we cross-referenced the EI and EDGAR datasets with other reputable sources. This included comparing hydropower generation and consumption figures with those reported by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and cross-checking CO2 emissions data with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reports. Such cross-referencing helps in validating the consistency and accuracy of the data.

**C.	Dataset Introduction**

Three datasets were implemented in this research. Dataset ‘Statistical Review of World Energy Data.xlsx’ collects the different energy statistical review data from all over the world between the years of 1965 to 2022, every single energy data is assigned two sheets, one for generating and one for consumption. Another dataset ‘Panel format.xlsx’ gives an overview of the world population distribution between 1965 to 2022, which helps to calculate the data per capita. 
The dataset ‘IEA-EDGAR fossil CO2 emissions’ published various fossil CO2 emissions data from all over the world between 1970 and 2022.

**D.	Data Preparation**

1.	Rationale behind data filtering and selection:
1.1	Focus on Nordic European Countries
The decision to focus on Nordic European countries was driven by their significant advancements in hydropower technology and usage. These countries have been at the forefront of incorporating hydropower into their national energy strategies, making them ideal case studies for understanding the role of hydropower in a modern energy mix. Additionally, Nordic Europe's commitment to environmental sustainability offers a unique perspective on the ecological impact of hydropower.

1.2	Emphasis on the Last Decade
Concentrating on data from the last decade (2012-2022) allows for an analysis of current trends and developments in hydropower. This period is particularly relevant due to significant advancements in renewable energy technologies and a global shift towards sustainable energy practices. Analyzing recent data provides insights into the current state and future potential of hydropower in the context of evolving environmental policies and climate change. In addition, combined with time series analysis, the changing curves of hydropower power supply and consumption in Norway can be visually displayed and compared with the Nordic countries. Thereby to further demonstrating the research questions.

1.3	Energy Mix
Incorporate other energy sources, such as solar and wind power which are addressed as components in Nordic countries’ energy mix structure, can give an argument in depth about Norway’s contribution to the energy mix compared to other Nordic countries.

2.	Preprocessing Steps
The preparation steps will be pivotal in ensuring that the datasets are primed for comprehensive analysis. By addressing these key aspects, the data will be rendered suitable for the multifaceted analytical approach required to answer our research questions effectively.

2.1	Normalization
Given the diverse range of data, including energy production in terawatt-hours (TW/h), consumption in exajoules (Ej), and CO2 emissions in tons per capita, normalization was essential. This step ensures comparability across different units of measurement, facilitating more accurate analyses and interpretations. Furthermore, a normalization of the population (pop) will provide a more equitable comparison across countries. 

2.2	Missing Data Handling
In instances of missing data, we plan to employ imputation techniques to maintain dataset integrity. For minor gaps, linear interpolation could be used, assuming a gradual change between known data points. For more significant gaps, we will refer to external sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) for supplementary data, ensuring the completeness of our datasets.

2.3	Data Conversion
The datasets could initially be in various formats, necessitating conversion to a uniform structure for analysis. This involves consolidating data into a single, coherent format suitable for machine learning and statistical analyses. Maintaining data integrity during this conversion process is a high priority.

2.4	Assigning Country Codes
To facilitate easier mapping and comparison across datasets, we plan to assign ISO country codes to each dataset entry. This step could be crucial for matching hydropower data with corresponding CO2 emission figures for each country efficiently.

**E.	Analytical Techniques**

1.	Machine Learning Classification Techniques
For analyzing hydropower production and consumption patterns, we plan to employ supervised machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random Forest was chosen for its robustness in handling large datasets and its ability to handle both categorical and continuous variables, making it suitable for our diverse datasets. For our final research, we have chosen the SVM model for its effectiveness in classifying data with a clear margin of separation, which we anticipate in differentiating patterns of hydropower usage among Nordic European countries. These algorithms will classify countries based on their hydropower production and consumption profiles, aiding in identifying distinct patterns and trends.

2.	Correlation Analysis Methods
To explore the relationship between hydropower usage and carbon emissions, we plan to utilize Pearson correlation analysis. [5] This method helps in quantifying the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables, in this case, hydropower data and CO2 emissions. This analysis is crucial in understanding whether an increase in hydropower usage correlates with a decrease in carbon emissions, thereby assessing the environmental impact of hydropower.

3.	Statistical Analysis Application
Statistical techniques, including regression analysis and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) [7], will be applied to compare hydropower with other green energy sources. Regression analysis helps in understanding how variables such as population growth and industrial development influence hydropower production and consumption. ANOVA is used to compare the mean values of different energy sources, providing insights into the effectiveness of hydropower relative to other renewable energies.

4.	Forecasting Future Trends
We will employ time series analysis methods like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing to forecast future trends in hydropower production and consumption, capturing both seasonal and long-term patterns. Scenario-based modeling will simulate various outcomes under different potential future developments, including technological advancements and policy shifts. [9] Machine learning models, such as LSTM networks, will augment traditional forecasting methods by analyzing complex historical data patterns. This section also integrates climate change projections to evaluate environmental impacts on hydropower and uses sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of different variables on our forecasts. Data visualization tools will be employed to effectively communicate these complex trends to stakeholders and policymakers.

5.	Efficiency Analysis
We plan to calculate the efficiency of hydropower plants using data on energy output and input. This efficiency will be compared with that of other renewable energy sources to gauge hydropower's relative performance. We will also analyze the evolution of hydropower efficiency over time, which will provide insights into the progress and advancements in hydropower technology. [6] This analysis is crucial for understanding the current state of hydropower efficiency and its potential trajectory in the renewable energy sector.

**F.	Ethical Considerations**

All the data resources in this research are published by official energy authorities and independent global databases. Hence, there is no personal privacy involved and relevant ethical issues.

**Ⅳ	DISCOVERIES AND DISCUSSION**

Hydropower production and consumption. Figure 2 illustrates the hydropower production and consumption trends compared to the other renewable energies wind and solar among the five Nordic European countries over the past decade. Overall, the region has experienced relatively stable trends in both hydropower production and consumption. Over the past ten years, Norway has consistently led in both hydropower generation and consumption, making it the top producer and consumer in the region. Sweden follows Norway, producing and consuming roughly 57% of what Norway does. Iceland, and Finland, on the other hand, have significantly lower figures, with each accounting for less than 30% of Norway’s production and consumption rates. 

In terms of the correlation between hydropower supply and demand, Norway and Sweden have shown a pattern where supply slightly exceeds demand in the recent seven years. The other three countries, namely Iceland, and Finland, have maintained a balanced state between their hydropower production and consumption throughout the decade.

Figure 2: Hydro generation & consumption
 
	Figure 2 also shows relatively stable hydroelectric energy production and consumption from 2012 to 2022, with production consistently exceeding consumption.

Figure 3: Solar generation & consumption

	Figure 3 displays the trends in solar energy generation and consumption in the targeted four Nordic European countries from 2012 to 2022. Across the decade, solar generation, and consumption in the Nordic European countries have remained relatively slow, with very slight increases. However, starting around 2018, there is a noticeable spike in solar generation and consumption, particularly in Sweden, where it rises sharply to reach approximately 2.5 TWh by 2022. In contrast, solar energy consumption remains the same as the generation across all four countries, which is almost negligible. Compared with Sweden, the other three countries are relatively weak in solar energy. Hence, solar energy is not yet a significant part of the energy consumed in these countries.

 Figure 4: Wind generation & consumption

Wind energy (Figure 4) shows a more pronounced increase in generation compared to solar energy. Sweden and Finland display a steady rise in wind energy generation over the years, with Sweden exceeding 30 TWh by 2022. Norway also shows an upward trend, it was even over Finland from 2019, but remains below Sweden in terms of wind energy generation. Iceland’s wind generation has remained consistently low throughout the decade. Consumption of wind energy closely mirrors the generation trends in each country, indicating that the produced wind energy is being consumed domestically. This suggests that wind energy is a more significant contributor to the renewable energy mix in these countries compared to solar energy.

Compared with solar and wind power, hydropower shows the potential to become the significant part of the renewable energy mix, particularly in terms of the contribution in Norway. Figure 5 is designed to showcase countries’ positions relative to their hydropower renewable energy production and consumption. The further to the right a country is, the higher its production, and the higher up on the graph, the greater its consumption.

 ![image](https://github.com/JianlingLi/Energy-Research-and-Analystics/assets/122969933/a28d8f33-e21f-4a80-88a1-6b49e18dd264)

 Figure 5: Country hydropower classification
 
Class 1(Green): This represents countries with both low hydropower generation and consumption.
Class 2 (Yellow): Countries in this class have moderate production but low consumption or vice versa.
Class 3 (Blue): These countries have high production but only moderate consumption, or the opposite.
Class 4 (Purple): Countries in this class have both very high hydropower production and consumption.
Norway is placed at the top right, indicating it has very high hydropower generation and consumption, thus fitting into Class 4. Sweden is also in Class 4, suggesting very high production and consumption, but it’s positioned below Norway, which means its consumption is slightly less than Norway’s, even if its production might be on par. Positioned at the bottom left, Iceland has both low hydropower production and consumption. 
	Both Norway and Sweden are leading in hydropower within the presented countries. Their production and consumption rates are significantly higher than the other nations on the graph. While Iceland has low production and consumption, there’s potential for growth considering its vast renewable resources. 
The above visualization and analysis do not consider per-capital supply and consumption data. If the Nordic countries’ population is considered, the results might be different. For instance, Iceland which has the smallest population, may be interesting to see how they perform in terms of hydropower generation and consumption.
The observed trends in hydropower production and consumption among Nordic European countries, particularly in Norway and Sweden, are not solely the result of natural resource availability or technological capability. They are significantly influenced by the energy policies and regulatory frameworks in place. Over the past decade, energy policies in these countries have increasingly focused on promoting renewable energy sources, including hydropower, in a bid to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.
In Norway, for instance, government policies have been instrumental in supporting hydropower, contributing to its status as the leading producer and consumer in the region. These policies include incentives for renewable energy production, regulations facilitating the construction and operation of hydropower plants, and initiatives aimed at enhancing energy efficiency. [2] Similarly, Sweden's energy policies, which emphasize low-carbon and renewable energy sources, have played a crucial role in shaping its hydropower sector. [8]
The impact of these policies extends beyond mere production and consumption figures. They have influenced the overall energy mix, leading to a substantial reduction in reliance on fossil fuels and a corresponding decrease in carbon emissions. Furthermore, these policy initiatives have set the stage for integrating hydropower with other renewable sources like wind and solar, creating a more diverse and sustainable energy portfolio.
	As we move forward, the evolving energy policies and regulations will continue to play a critical role in shaping the future of hydropower. The focus is likely to shift towards balancing energy production with environmental conservation, ensuring that the expansion of hydropower does not come at the expense of ecological integrity. This will require a nuanced approach, where policies not only support hydropower development but also address the potential environmental impacts, such as effects on river ecosystems and biodiversity.
